## 📌 Description of Concepts

### 1. 🔒 Encapsulation
A `BankAccount` class encapsulates private variables `_balance` and `_accountHolder`, with controlled access through getter methods and deposit/withdraw operations.

### 2. 🌳 Inheritance
A `Student` class inherits properties and behavior from a `Person` class using the `extends` keyword.

### 3. 🎭 Polymorphism
Multiple `Animal` subclasses (`Dog` and `Cat`) override the `makeSound()` method to demonstrate method overriding.

### 4. 🎨 Abstraction
An abstract class `Shape` declares an abstract method `draw()`. Subclasses like `Circle` and `Square` implement the method.
